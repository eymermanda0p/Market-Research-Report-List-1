<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dynamic Seals Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Seal</li><li>Non-contact Seal</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Dynamic seals are essential components in various applications, categorized into contact and non-contact seals. Contact seals create a barrier through direct contact with the moving surface, providing effective sealing against fluids and contaminants, making them suitable for high-pressure environments. Non-contact seals, on the other hand, maintain a gap between surfaces, reducing friction and wear while offering good sealing performance in low-pressure applications. Both types are crucial for maintaining equipment efficiency and longevity across industries such as automotive, aerospace, and manufacturing.</p></p>
