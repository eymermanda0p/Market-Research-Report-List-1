<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hyperspectral Imaging Technology Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Spatial Scanning Technology</li><li>Spectral Scanning Technology</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Hyperspectral imaging technology divides the market into two main types: spatial scanning and spectral scanning. Spatial scanning captures images across different wavelengths simultaneously, producing detailed spatial information for each pixel. This method is beneficial for applications requiring high-resolution images. In contrast, spectral scanning acquires data by sequentially capturing images across various wavelengths, allowing for comprehensive spectral analysis. This approach is ideal for applications that prioritize spectral detail over spatial resolution, such as mineral identification and environmental monitoring.</p></p>
